% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.
%
% Questions regarding SIGS should be sent to
% Adrienne Griscti ---> griscti@acm.org
%
% Questions/suggestions regarding the guidelines, .tex and .cls files, etc. to
% Gerald Murray ---> murray@hq.acm.org
%
% For tracking purposes - this is V3.1SP - APRIL 2009

Your typical abstract.

\section{Introduction}
Explain what accountability and privacy actually are in the context of internet, motivate why anyone would need it (maybe case examples), who would need it and why no one has it.

\section{Goals}

\section{Accountability}
There are a lot of cool papers. AIP must be explained, maybe IPA or Mirkovic and Reiher as a second approach (or even both?).
\subsection{Accountable Internet Protocol}

\section{Privacy}
\subsection{Tor instead of IP}
\subsection{end-to-end encryption}
\subsection{NAT}

\section{Accountable and Private Internet Protocol}

\section{Summary}

\section{Conclusion}

%
% The following two commands are all you need in the
% initial runs of your .tex file to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{sigproc}  % sigproc.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:
% latex bibtex latex latex
% to resolve all references
%
% ACM needs 'a single self-contained file'!
%
%APPENDICES are optional

% That's all folks!
