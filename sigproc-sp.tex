\section{Introduction}
The history of the modern Internet as we know it today goes back as far as the early eighties -- IPv4, ICMP and TCP, which where all specified in 1981, together with 1984's DNS, still are the foundation on which all Internet traffic is being transported.

The way these technologies are designed is heavily reflecting the challenges that were of importance at that time -- namely "the creation of a distributed communication network that is robust against packet loss and other network failures; support across multiple types of networks and communication services; and the management of Internet resources in a cost-effective and distributed way" \cite{mot}.

As time went by and the Internet began to grow bigger and bigger, new challenges that where not incorporated into the original design arose. The following work will focus on two of the biggest of those: accountability and privacy.

While there is already a plethora of technologies, that enable for varying levels of privacy, e.g., Tor, NAT and the likes, accountability is on a completely different page. Not only is accountability hard to guarantee, but it tends to be mutually exclusive with privacy. This is largely due to the fact that the first usually means strengthening sources addresses while the latter usually means weakening them \cite{apip}.

To delve deeper into these topics, section~\ref{sec:acc} explains what accountability is, why it is needed and by whom and present some recent research projects while section~\ref{sec:priv} does the same for privacy. Furthermore, section~\ref{sec:apip} presents the \emph{Accountable and Private Internet Protocol}, a recent attempt at creating a solution that balances between accountabilty and privacy \cite{apip}.

%Explain what accountability and privacy actually are in the context of internet, motivate why anyone would need it (maybe case examples), who would need it and why no one has it.

\section{Accountability}
\label{sec:acc}
A lot of crime and chaos in the real world is being prevented because we have mechanisms in place that associate distinct persons or group of persons with actions, making everyone accountable for most of what they are doing. The Internet, as we have it today, is largely devoid of such mechanisms. Techniques like source IP spoofing can give everyone easy anonymity and enables for malicious actions such as denial of service attacks without having to fear any consequences.

Accountability would thus be a welcomed trait in the Internet, as it can greatly help to stop and even prevent attacks. What is needed to provide such accountability is some efficient way to verify the alleged identity of a source, something that is not done directly on the network layer of today's internet. 

Approaches to fix these shortcomings exist, but many of them come with their own shortcomings, rendering them not ideal for real world deployment, e.g., complicated mechanisms changing "the free-access model of the Internet", the need for external sources of trust, or the need for manual filtering by network operators \cite{aip}.

%There are a lot of cool papers. AIP must be explained, maybe IPA or Mirkovic and Reiher as a second approach (or even both?).
\subsection{Accountable Internet Protocol}
Andersen et al. propose AIP \cite{aip}, the \emph{Accountable Internet Protocol}, as a replacement for the current IP. Hosts and domains using AIP are enabled to prove their identity without the need for an external trusted authority.

\subsubsection{Basic design}

In AIP, the transition to prefixed CIDR-style addresses is reverted in favor of a simpler multi component address. Each independently administered network gets divided into one or more \emph{accountability domains} (ADs) by its administrative unit, providing each AD with a globally unique identifier. Likewise, every end host must be provided a globally unique EID identifier, leading to an address scheme of \texttt{AD:EID}. In case of need for hierarchically organized accountability domains, the scheme can be extended to \texttt{AD$_1$:AD$_2$:\ldots:AD$_k$:EID}. Furthermore, if a host connects to an accountability domain via multiple network interfaces, each interface is provided its own EID by altering the \emph{interface bits} -- the last eight bits of the EID.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\label{fig:aipadr}
	\newcolumntype{C}{>{\centering}X}
	\begin{tabularx}{0.47\textwidth}{|c|C|c|}
		\hline & & \\
 		Crypto vers & Public key hash & Interface \\
		8 bits & 144 bits & 8 bits \\ & & \\
		\hline
	\end{tabularx}
	\caption{AIP addresses consist of a version number, a hash of a public key and an interface identifier 		(which is set to zero for accountability domains) \cite{aip}}
\end{figure}

This simplification of the addressing enables for \emph{self-certifying} addresses: the main part of the 160 bit long AIP address is simply a 144 bit long hash of the endpoint's respective accountability domain's public key (Figure \ref{fig:aipadr}).

\subsubsection{Verification}

Now, when an end point tries to send a packet, it is the first-hop router's duty to verify the end point's identity. When a packet from a not-verified host arrives, the packet is dropped and the router replies with a \emph{verification packet} V. This packet is signed with a periodically created router specific secret. The sending host signs this packet as well, returns it to the router, which can now verify the sender's identity with the help of his private key, permitting the sender to resend the dropped packet as well as subsequent packets.
